# Web-Dev-1-Midterm-Race
This is the midterm project from my Web Dev 1 class. The assignment was to create a race between 2 cars. Click the "stop sign" to start the race. Whichever car crosses the line first wins the race. If both tie, then the race ends in a tie. Click the "stop sign" to race again.

Two bugs noted: Sometimes the cars don't stop after crossing the line. Additionally, after the race ends if you click the button to restart the cars don't start from the beginning. This was an early project in my web dev career. If I were to continue development with the skills I have now, these would be the first things I fixed.
