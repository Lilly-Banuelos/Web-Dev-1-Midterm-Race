# Web-Dev-1-Midterm-Race
This is the midterm project from my Web Dev 1 class. The assignment was to create a race between 2 cars. Click the "stop sign" to start the race. Whichever car crosses the line first wins the race. If both tie, then the race ends in a tie. Click the "stop sign" to race again.

One bug noted: Sometimes the cars don't stop after crossing the line. This was an early project in my web dev career. If I were to continue development with the skills I have now, this would be the first thing I fixed.
